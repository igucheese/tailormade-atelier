## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Structure**
    * `master`: The stable, production-ready source code.
    * `develop`: The branch for development verification and testing new feature implementations.
    * `release/vX.X.X`: The main branch targeted for the next release. Working branches should be created from here.
2. **Getting Started**
    * Before starting any work, please create an Issue (or check existing ones) on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/igucheese/tailormade/issues) to discuss your proposal or bug report.
    * Create your working branch off of the latest `release/vX.X.X` branch.
    * Please refer to the branch naming rules below.
3. **Pull Requests**
    * Once your changes are complete, create a Pull Request targeting the `develop` branch.
    * Assign `@igucheese` as the reviewer.
    * Merging will be handled exclusively by `@igucheese` after the review is complete.
